# AFTU
AFTU - Auto Forensics Tool USB, tool developed for Red Teamers to recover key data fast, This tool was for sale on my personel website for a long time and has been purchased enough that I can feel comfortable to share it for free now. Please excuse the simplisticness of this tool as it was original designed and wrote by myself before I had any real programming ability, and was in the earily stages of use


# Design and Dev
Tool tool was developed by myself during my time working in doing offensive security, when testing it was important to pull details as fast as was possible from a target system, in person. This was designed to work on a usb stick portable on windows XP - 7, altough I dont see why it would not work on Windows10 

Deisgned both for professional use and for having fun with friends at hacking confrences to show off how something so simple can be used to do such a dangerous attack

# Usage
download the git as it is, unzip the git to a usb stick exsaclty as it is, and it will be ready to run on any windows system


# Features:
* Writes a key-logger to System32 and will log all keys and you can sync
the logs when the USB is plugged back in
* Puts all used browser passwords stored in the internet browsers to a
text file on the USB
