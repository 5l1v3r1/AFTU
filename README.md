# AFTU
AFTU - Auto Forensics Tool USB, tool developed for Red Teamers to recover key data fast, This tool was for sale on my personel website for a long time and has been purchased enough that I can feel comfortable to share it for free now. Please excuse the simplisticness of this tool as it was original designed and wrote by myself before I had any real programming ability, and was in the earily stages of use


# Design and Dev
Tool tool was developed by myself during my time working in doing offensive security, when testing it was important to pull details as fast as was possible from a target system, in person. This was designed to work on a usb stick portable on windows XP - 7, altough I dont see why it would not work on Windows10
